# RunosSolver


This project solves simple cases for the Runos tile game using C++.

The actual game is called Rummikub. While playing it on my holiday, I thought it would be a fun challenge to try to compute the best moves. The code I created does find the best move using a BFS search, but only up to a fixed minimal depth. It was a fun challenge!
